# CSFinal
My Web Development Final Project created for CS4. 24 is a onlime game built on the
WAMP stack. 



#Credits
I used the Bootstrap library for most of my CSS.
Look in files for any StackOverflow credits.



#Limitations
The program uses only a tempory session cookie to store the user name and information.
This can lead to problems if multiple user enter the same userName. If multiple users with the same
name enter the scoreboard only the user with the highest score will be displayed.
