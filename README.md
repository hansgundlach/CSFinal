# Description
My Web Development Final Project created for CS4. 24 is a onlime game built on the
WAMP stack.The website displays 4 numbers on the page.
The playerâ€™s goal is to make 24 using only those four numbers and the parentheses, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.  
For Example, you could make 24 from 6 6 6 6 by adding 6+6+6+6. The player enters their solutions in the input and my project tells if the player's formula is correct.
If the player wants another problem, my game will display another set of numbers that can form 24 (Not all sets of 4 numbers can be combined to form 24).


#Credits
I used the Bootstrap library for most of my CSS.
Look in files for any StackOverflow credits. Session variable and login are based
loosly on example given by Dr.Bricker.


#Limitations
The program uses only a tempory session cookie to store the user name and information.
This can lead to problems if multiple user enter the same userName. If multiple users with the same
name enter the scoreboard only the user with the highest score will be displayed.
